Date: 7th March 2020 

NB: THE APPLICATION REQUIRES INTERNET CONNECTION TO RUN PROPERLY
External Resources Used: 
  The structure and the design of the platform was inspired by
  = https://www.vnsaga.com/work/ 

  Fonts used were loaded from the font-awesome CDN 
    =https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css

  Images are been loaded from the lorem-picsum website 
  = https://i.pravatar.cc/400?img=51

  Text dummy content were collected from lorem Ipsum generator
  = https://www.lipsum.com/

  In rare instances where content or code samples were picked 
  online from supporting platforms,links have been provided 
  as comments above the beginning of such code sample. 
  Otherwise, everything was manually done and pushed to this github  
  repository below: 
  = https://github.com/frimpongopoku/ALU_Web_Dev/tree/Mentors_part_1

  Dummy mentors were used in this application. 
  * I used javascript to generate the html content dynamically 
  instead of copying and pasting html content which makes changes 
  and tracking very hard to manage.
  * Animations were done by simply swapping and removing CSS classes 
  in different situations. 

  Please check the (js) folder to get access to files that contain more 
  explanations to mechanisms being used, and some choice.
